# University-Network-Infrastructure-Simulation-Cisco-Packet-Tracer-
This project models a complex university network infrastructure with 10 campuses and 8 routers, designed and simulated in Cisco Packet Tracer. The network includes subnetting, OSPF routing, DHCP, DNS, and serial connections, along with a dedicated university website server.

Features
Multi-Campus Network: 8 campuses with independent and interconnected networks.
Routing Configuration: OSPF protocol for efficient dynamic routing.
Subnetting: Logical segmentation for optimized network performance.
DHCP Implementation: Remote DHCP server setup using IP helper-address.
DNS Configuration: Domain Name System for hostname resolution.
University Website: A local web server to host university-related resources.
Connectivity Testing: Ping, traceroute, and performance analysis.
Project Structure
configurations/ → CLI commands for each router and network component.
packet_tracer_files/ → .pkt files for Cisco Packet Tracer simulation.
docs/ → Research paper and LaTeX source files.
results/ → Screenshots and logs of network tests and performance metrics.
How to Use
Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
Load router configurations using the provided CLI scripts.
Verify connectivity using ping and traceroute.
Check routing tables (show ip route).
Test DHCP and DNS functionalities.
Access the university website from a client system.
Requirements
Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x
Basic understanding of networking concepts and OSPF routing
